Simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices

### Write Maintainable Tests
Tests only break when your app breaks, not implementation details

### Develop with Confidence
Interact with your app the same way as your users

### Accessible by Default
Built-in selectors find elements the way users do to help you write inclusive code

## The Problem

 * You want tests for your UI that avoid including implementation details and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for which they are intended.
 * You want your tests to be maintainable so refactors (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down.

## The Solution

The Testing Library family of libraries is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.

# Guiding Principle
  
The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
